    <p>Like many other colonies, Burma achieved its independence in 1948, and was, for a brief period, a democratic state. Though independent, Burma never achieved overall peace, and near constant civil war has plagued Burma since independence. Broken British promises and World War 2 alliances created the tension that devolved into minority ethnic unrest and dreams of independent states. These freedom and independence movements, both violent and non-violent, were unanimously met with violent and brutal suppression. </p>

    <p>Democratic rule of Burma ended in 1962 when General Ne Win gained control through a military coup d’état. The country has been under military rule more or less since then. Throughout the 70’s Burma experimented with its own form of socialism mixed with superstition. These failed policies led to a crippled economy and Burma was transformed from the largest rice exporter in Asia to a rice importer. Prior to this period, Burma had high levels of education and literacy and was home to some of the best universities in Southeast Asia. The educational institutions were dismantled during this period and the general population suffered intellectually.</p>

    <p>General Ne Win’s rule and the reduction in Burmese living standards incited opposition and his time in power was marked by near constant revolts and protests. The biggest protests came in 1988, called the “8888 Uprising,” and were led mainly by students. These protests, like others before, were met with violence and massive loss of civilian life. During this period, a common enemy led to unlikely bonds and pairing between urban Burman students and the already organized minority resistance groups. </p>

    <p>The military authorities never ceded power but made illusions of concessions over the next few decades. In 1990, Burma held its first free elections since Ne Win had gained power and Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party, the NDL, won over 80% of the seats of government. However, these results were never acknowledged or implemented and many members of the opposition were jailed or disappeared. Over this time period the ruling authorities made many symbolic changes to shed the yoke of British imperialism, such as changing the name of the country from Burma to Myanmar and the spelling of many cities’ names. The capital was also relocated from Rangoon to the newly created city of Nay Pyi Taw.</p>

    <p>Despite these changes, and a slight easing of suppression, the resistance never ceased. In 2007, another large revolt broke out, this time led by the saffron-robed Buddhist monks and aptly titled the “Saffron Revolution.”  Again, this movement was met with an iron fist and a massive loss of civilian life. These actions led to some of the strongest international sanctions to date.</p>

    <p>In 2008 nature itself turned on Myanmar, when Cyclone Nargis claimed the lives of over 100,000 people and did massive damage to the country’s already underdeveloped infrastructure. The military government was impotent in providing assistance for those affected and stalled international aid out of fear of espionage.</p>

    <p>Over the last five years the government has taken some steps to move toward a civilian government and democratic constitution. Exactly how far these steps will go and how real they are is debatable. Some positive signs have been the release from house arrest of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her subsequent election to parliament, as well as the release of some of the political prisoners. The remainders of the political prisoners have been promised to be released entirely by the end of 2013.
